#Enterprise 2 exam


This exam was difficult, and i really learned a lot. I hope I did not misinterpret the requirements, and believe I solved what i could as it's meant to be 
solved.

##Requirements:
###R requirements
I did R1, R2 and R3. 

I did not do R4 or R5.

I tried to do some AMQP testing in e2e test, however it did not work properly. I still included the test, and commented 
out what made it fail. It is not flaky.

###T requirements
I did T1 and T2.

I did not do T3 and T4

I could make more functions for the admin to do, however the exam did not ask of this. It's a nice to have feature, but not something I prioritized.
